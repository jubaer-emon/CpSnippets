// Wrong answer:
// Print your solution! Print debug output, as well.
// Are you clearing all data structures between test cases?
// Can your algorithm handle the whole range of input?
// Read the full problem statement again.
// Do you handle all corner cases correctly? (N=0,1 etc.)
// Have you understood the problem correctly?
// Any uninitialized variables?
// Any overflows?
// Confusing N and M, i and j, etc.?
// Floating point numbers
// - Any NaNs (ex. taking the square root of a negative number)?
// - Try using a type with more precision (ex. long double instead of double in C++).
// - Are you printing the output to the correct amount of precision?
// Are you sure your algorithm works?
// - Go through the algorithm for a simple case / write some testcases to run your algorithm on.
// - Write a test case generator and compare the outputs of your solution against
//   that of a (simpler) slow solution, or a model solution if available.
// What special cases have you not thought of?
// Are you sure the STL functions you use work as you think?
// Any undefined behavior? It can result in different outputs locally vs online. Examples:
// - Uninitialized variables
// - Not returning anything from non-void functions
// - Array out of bounds (Considering using vec.at())
// - Signed integer overflow
// - Shifting a 32-bit integer by >=32 bits
// Add some assertions, maybe resubmit.
// Create some testcases to run your algorithm on.
// Go through the algorithm for a simple case.
// Go through this list again.
// Explain your algorithm to a teammate.
// Ask the teammate to look at your code.
// Go for a small walk, e.g. to the toilet.
// Is your output format correct? (including whitespace)
// Rewrite your solution from the start or let a teammate do it.
// 
// Stress-test:
// Generate random input and compare output with brute-force solution
//
// Runtime error:
// Have you tested all corner cases locally?
// Any uninitialized variables?
// Are you reading or writing outside the range of any vector?
// Any assertions that might fail?
// Any possible division by 0? (mod 0 for example)
// Any possible infinite recursion?
// Invalidated pointers or iterators?
// Are you using too much memory?
// Debug with resubmits (e.g. remapped signals, see Various).
// 
// Time limit exceeded:
// Do you have any possible infinite loops?
// What is the complexity of your algorithm?
// Are you copying a lot of unnecessary data? (References)
// How big is the input and output? (consider scanf)
// Avoid vector, map. (use arrays/unordered_map)
// What do your teammates think about your algorithm?
// 10^9 operations -> O(n) algorithm is not allowed (10^8~5x10^8 allowed)
// Did you remove debug output before submitting?
// n <10 O(n!), <20 O(2^n), <400, O(n^3), <7500 O(n^2), <7e4 O(nv/n), <5e5 O(nlogn), <5e6 O(n), <1e18 O(logn) 
//
// Memory limit exceeded:
// What is the max amount of memory your algorithm should need?
// Are you clearing all data structures between test cases?
// Switch from long long to int
// 
// Pre-submit:
// Write a few simple test cases if sample is not enough.
// Are time limits close? If so, generate max cases.
// Is the memory usage fine?
// Could anything overflow?
// Make sure to submit the right file.
// Limits: int +2x10^9, ll +9x10^18, vector 10^7 usually
