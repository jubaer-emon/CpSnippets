Snippets I use in compettive programming compettitions (Codeforces, ICPC Prelim).

Place this folder in the workspace which may contain the `.vscode` subfolder and run the python file to generate the snippets.

Generate notebook with [codes2pdf](https://github.com/Erfaniaa/codes2pdf) in Linux or WSL. `codes2pdf` doesn't work on windows without WSL.

# TODO

- [x] fix: script fail when .vscode folder not present
- [x] pdf generator
- [ ] organize files into topics
- [ ] graph snippets
